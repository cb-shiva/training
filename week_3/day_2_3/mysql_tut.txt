Basic aggregation

Aggregates are more popular than any other lookup topic here, by a ratio of more than 2 to 1.

Basic aggregation is the simplest grouping query pattern: for column foo, display the smallest, largest, sum, average or some other statistic of column bar values:

SELECT foo, MIN(bar) AS bar 
FROM tbl 
GROUP BY foo 

Return the highest bar value for each foo, ordering top to bottom by that value:

SELECT foo, MAX(bar) AS Count 
FROM tbl 
GROUP BY foo 
ORDER BY Count DESC; 

Ditto for AVG(), COUNT() etc. The pattern easily extends to multiple grouping column expressions.

For aggregating functions like MIN() and MAX() that return a single value, there may be multiple instances of the result. If you wish to see them, put the aggregating query in a subquery and join to it from a direct query on the table:

SELECT a.foo, a.bar 
FROM tbl a 
JOIN ( 
  SELECT foo, MAX(bar) AS Count 
  FROM tbl 
  GROUP BY foo 
) b ON a.foo=b.foo AND a.bar=b.count 
ORDER BY a.foo, a.bar; 

MySQL introduced the SQL extension GROUP_CONCAT(), which makes short work of listing items in groups. For example, given a table of suppliers and the parts they make ...

CREATE TABLE supparts(supID char(2),partID char(2)); 
INSERT INTO supparts VALUES 
('s1','p1'),('s1','p2'),('s1','p3'),('s1','p4'),('s1','p5'),('s1','p6'), 
('s2','p1'),('s2','p2'),('s3','p2'),('s4','p2'),('s4','p4'),('s4','p5'); 

list suppliers for each part:

SELECT partID,GROUP_CONCAT(supID ORDER BY supID) AS Suppliers  
FROM supparts  
GROUP BY partID; 
+--------+-------------+ 
| partID | Suppliers   | 
+--------+-------------+ 
| p1     | s1,s2       | 
| p2     | s1,s2,s3,s4 | 
| p3     | s1          | 
| p4     | s1,s4       | 
| p5     | s1,s4       | 
| p6     | s1          | 
+--------+-------------+ 

When there are several tables to be joined, the beginner may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the problem. Suppose you're asked to retrieve the top computer desk salesperson for this schema:

drop table if exists salespersons, orders, orderlines, products; 
create table salespersons(salespersonid int,name char(8)); 
insert into salespersons values(1,'Sam'),(2,'Xavier'); 
create table orders(orderid int,salespersonid int); 
insert into orders values(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,2),(5,2); 
create table orderlines(lineid int,orderid int,productid int,qty int); 
insert into orderlines values(1,1,1,1),(2,1,1,2),(3,2,2,1),(4,3,1,1),(5,4,1,1),(6,5,2,2); 
create table products(productid int,name char(32)); 
insert into products values(1,'computer desk'),(2,'lamp'),(3,'desk chair'); 

Two rules of thumb help with problems like this: solve one step at a time, and work from inside out. Here "inside out" means start by building the join list needed to retrieve sales data:

from salespersons s 
join orders       o using(salespersonid) 
join orderlines   l using(orderid) 
join products     p using(productid)   

Test those joins with a query that just lists sales data:

select s.name, p.name, l.qty 
from salespersons s 
join orders       o using(salespersonid) 
join orderlines   l using(orderid) 
join products     p using(productid) 
+--------+---------------+------+ 
| name   | name          | qty  | 
+--------+---------------+------+ 
| Sam    | computer desk |    1 | 
| Sam    | computer desk |    2 | 
| Sam    | lamp          |    1 | 
| Sam    | computer desk |    1 | 
| Xavier | computer desk |    1 | 
| Xavier | lamp          |    2 | 
+--------+---------------+------+ 

Now we just need to filter for 'computer desk' sales, add aggregation, and pick off the top seller:

select s.name, sum(l.qty) as n      -- sum quantities 
from salespersons s 
join orders       o using(salespersonid) 
join orderlines   l using(orderid) 
join products     p using(productid) 
where p.name='computer desk'     
group by s.name                     -- aggregate by salesperson 
order by n desc limit 1;            -- order by descending sum, pick off top value 
+------+------+ 
| name | n    | 
+------+------+ 
| Sam  |    4 | 
+------+------+ 

If columns other than the GROUP BY column must be retrieved, and if the grouping expression does not have a strictly 1:1 relationship with those columns, then to avoid returning arbitrary values for those non-grouping columns, you must put the GROUP BY query in a subquery and join that result to the other columns, for example:

SELECT s.partID, s, thiscol, s.thatcol, anothercol, x.Suppliers 
FROM supparts s 
JOIN ( 
  SELECT partID,GROUP_CONCAT(supID ORDER BY supID) AS Suppliers  
  FROM supparts  
  GROUP BY partID 
) x USING(partID)

Aggregate across columns

You track squash court bookings and fees. A court booking has one fee, but it has two member references, and those can be the same if one member has brought a guest. For each booking row, the fee is to be split between the two members. What query correctly aggregates fees including cases where the two members of record are the same? 

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS bookings; 
CREATE TABLE bookings ( 
  court_id int(11) NOT NULL, 
  member1 int(11) NOT NULL, 
  member2 int(11) NOT NULL, 
  time timestamp NOT NULL, 
  fee decimal(5,2) NOT NULL 
); 

INSERT INTO bookings ( court_id , member1 , member2 , time , fee ) 
VALUES  
(1, 1000, 1001, '2009-09-09 15:49:38', 3.00),  
(2, 1000, 1000, '2009-09-08 15:50:04', 3.00); 

For this data the correct result is

member fees 
1000   4.50 
1001   1.50 

An efficient solution, posted by 'laptop alias' on a MySQL forum:

SELECT member, ROUND(SUM(fee/2),2) AS total 
FROM ( 
  SELECT member1 AS member, fee FROM bookings 
  UNION ALL 
  SELECT member2, fee FROM bookings 
) AS tmp 
GROUP BY member;

Aggregates across multiple joins

Given a parent table and two child tables, a query which sums values in both child tables, grouping on a parent table column, returns sums that are exactly twice as large as they should be. In this example from the MySQL General Discussion list:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS packageItem,packageCredit,packageItemTax; 
CREATE TABLE packageItem ( 
 packageItemID INT,  
 packageItemName CHAR(20),  
 packageItemPrice DECIMAL(10,2) 
); 
INSERT INTO packageItem VALUES(1,'Delta Hotel',100.00); 

CREATE TABLE packageCredit ( 
 packageCreditID INT,  
 packageCreditItemID INT,

Aggregates of specified size

Find the values of a table column c1 for which there are a specified number of listed values in another column c2.

To get an overview of the values of c2 for each value of c1:

SELECT 
  c1,  
  GROUP_CONCAT(c2 ORDER BY c2) AS 'C2 values' 
FROM table 
GROUP BY c1; 

To retrieve a list of c1 values for which there exist specific values in another column c2, you need an IN clause specifying the c2 values and a HAVING clause specifying the required number of different items in the list ...

SELECT c1  
FROM table 
WHERE c2 IN (1,2,3,4) 
GROUP BY c1 
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c2)=4; 

This is easy to generalise to multiple column expressions, and a HAVING clause specifying any number of items from the IN list.

Avoiding repeat aggregation

In a good introductory tutorial on MySQL subqueries, Jeremy Cole developed a triply nested query to retrieve the name, population, head of state, and number of official languages in countries with the most official languages. The query uses two tables from the MySQL world database:

CREATE TABLE country ( 
  Code char(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT '' PRIMARY KEY, 
  Name char(52) NOT NULL DEFAULT '', 
  Population int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0', 
  HeadOfState char(60) DEFAULT NULL, 
  ... other columns ... 
);

  CountryCode char(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT '' PRIMARY KEY, 
  Language char(30) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',

Cascading aggregates

When you have parent-child-grandchild tables, eg companies, users, actions, and your query requirement is for per-parent aggregates from the child table and per-child aggregates from the grandchild table, then cascading joins yield spuriously multiplied counts, and correlated subqueries fail because the second correlated subquery cannot find a visible joining column.

One solution is to use derived tables. Assuming ...

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS companies,users,actions; 
CREATE TABLE companies (id int, name char(10)); 
INSERT INTO COMPANIES VALUES(1,'abc ltd'),(2,'xyz inc'); 
CREATE TABLE users (id INT,companyid INT); 
INSERT INTO users VALUES(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,2),(5,2); 
CREATE TABLE actions (id INT, userid INT, date DATE);  
INSERT INTO actions VALUES

Combine Group_Concat() with counts

Rather than list instances including repeats on one line, you want to list distinct instances and their counts. One way is to do a simple GROUP BY query and in your application layer remove the newlines from the result. Or you can do it in one step:

drop table if exists t; 
create table t ( 
  type int(10) , 
  instance int(10)  
) ; 
insert into t values  
(1,4),(1,7),(1,9),(1,10),(2,2),(2,3),(2,5),(2,6),(2,8),(3,1),(4,11); 

select group_concat( concat( type,'(',qty,')') separator ', ') list  
from ( 
  select type, count(*) qty  
  from t  
  group by type 
) n 
+------------------------+ 
| list                   | 
+------------------------+ 
| 1(4), 2(5), 3(1), 4(1) | 
+------------------------+

Correlated aggregating subqueries

If you need a child table aggregate result for each row in a query, what's faster, putting the correlated aggregating subquery in the SELECT list, or in the FROM clause?

Thus, given tables stocks(id, user, ticker,lastvalue) and transactions(id, sid, action, qty, price, commission), and the requirement to retrieve stock values and per-stock transaction counts, which of these queries will run faster?

select ticker, id, lastvalue, (select count(*) from transactions where sid=stocks.id) N  
from stocks; 

... or ...

select s.ticker, s.id, s.lastvalue, t.N 
from stocks s  
join ( 
  select sid, count(*) N  
  from transactions 
  group by sid 
) t on s.id=t.sid; 

The first query's syntax is simpler, so it's often the first choice. EXPLAIN reports that the second query requires examination of more rows than the first query does. 

But benchmarks with caching turned off show that the second query is much faster--mainly because it executes one subquery rather than a subquery per row.

If you have a choice, put the aggregating subquery in the FROM clause.

Cross-aggregates

Given the table authorbook(authid INT, bookid INT), what query finds the books who have authors with more than one book in the table?

Even one level of recursion can induce a mild trance. Escape the trance by taking the problem one step at a time. First write the query that finds the authors with multiple books. Then join an outer query to that on authorid, and have the outer query select bookid:

SELECT a1.bookid 
FROM authorbook a1 
INNER JOIN ( 
  SELECT authid,count(bookid) 
  FROM authorbook a2 
  GROUP BY authid 
  HAVING COUNT(bookid)>1 
) AS a3 ON a1.authid=a3.authid;

Every paying customer wins a prize

A superstore is running a promotion: each day, every fifth a customer wins a prize. Each day you're given a text file with data columns for customerID, timestamp and order amount. How do you find every fifth customer? 

Load the data into a table, then write the query inside out; with this kind of problem, nested queries are a boon.

1. Using Load Data Infile, load the text file into a table (indexless for speed) named tbl with columns for customerID, timestamp and amount, and index the table on (customerID, timestamp). 

2. Write a query that tracks per-customer order by timestamp with user variables:

Group data by datetime periods

To group rows by a time period whose length in minutes divides evenly into 60, use this formula:

GROUP BY ((60/periodMinutes) * HOUR( thistime ) + FLOOR( MINUTE( thistime ) / periodMinutes )) 

where thistime is the TIME column and periodMinutes is the period length in minutes. So to group by 15-min periods, write ...

SELECT ...

Nested, banded aggregation

Show only one child row per parent row

Given tables parent(id int not null primary key, etc...) and child (id int not null primary key, pid int not null references parent (id), etc...), how do we write a query that retrieves only one child row per pid even when the child table has multiple matching rows? MySQL permits use of GROUP BY even when the SELECT list specifies no aggregate function, so this will work:

select p.id, c.id  
from parent p  
join child c on p.id=c.pid 
group by p.id; 

But is it accurate? No, because it displays only the first c.pid value it happens to find. For further discussion see Within-group aggregates.

Track state changes

You have a table containing a sequence of IDs, states and dates. The query requirement is to list state changes and their dates ordered by date, and count instances of each sequenced state. This data from a blog entry by a Russian MySQLer calling himself Quassnoi ...

Values linked with all values of another column

You have a table in which each row references one text and one keyword in the text ... 

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS keywords; 
CREATE TABLE keywords (txtID int, keyword char(8)); 
INSERT INTO keywords VALUES(1 , 'foo'),(2 , 'bar'),(1 , 'foo'),(2 , 'foo'); 

... and you want a list of texts which include every keyword.

You might think you have to join and match. You don't. All you need to do is count the distinct keywords which occur for each text, then for each text compare that number with the entire list of distinct keywords:

SELECT txtID, COUNT(DISTINCT keyword) AS N 
FROM keywords 
GROUP BY txtID 
HAVING N = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT keyword) FROM keywords); 
+-------+---+ 
| txtID | N | 
+-------+---+ 
|     2 | 2 |

Within-group aggregates

You have a products table with columns item, supplier, price. Multiple suppliers offer various prices for the same item. You need to find the supplier with the lowest price for each item. 

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS products; 
CREATE TABLE products(item int,supplier int,price decimal(6,2)); 
INSERT INTO products VALUES(1,1,10),(1,2,15),(2,2,20),(2,1,21),(2,2,18); 
SELECT * FROM products; 
+------+----------+-------+ 
| item | supplier | price | 
+------+----------+-------+ 
|    1 |        1 | 10.00 | 
|    1 |        2 | 15.00 | 
|    2 |        2 | 20.00 | 
|    2 |        1 | 21.00 | 
|    2 |        2 | 18.00 | 
+------+----------+-------+ 

Your first thought may be to GROUP BY item, but that is not guaranteed to return the correct supplier value for each minimum item price. Grouping by both item and supplier will return more information than you want. Nor can you write WHERE price=MIN(...) because the query engine will evaluate the WHERE clause before it knows the MIN value. 

This is the problem of aggregating within aggregates. It is sometimes called the 'groupwise aggregates' problem, but the term 'groupwise' is ambiguous. We think better names for it are subaggregates, inner aggregates, or within-group aggregates. 

It's easy to show that the within-group aggregates problem is a form of the problem of returning values from non-grouping columns in a GROUP BY query. Suppose you write ...

SELECT item, supplier, Min(price) 
FROM products 
GROUP BY item; 

Will this reliably return the correct supplier per item? No. Unless there is exactly one supplier per item, the supplier value returned will be arbitrary. To retrieve the correct supplier for each item, you need more query logic.

Here are six solutions. As you'll see, some are very slow, a couple are quite fast, and some work for only some versions of the problem:

1. Self-exclusion join solution: One way to model within-group minima or maxima is via an left self exclusion join...

SELECT p1.item, p1.supplier, p1.price 
FROM products AS p1 
LEFT JOIN products AS p2 ON p1.item  = p2.item AND p1.price > p2.price 
WHERE p2.item IS NULL; 

...because in the resultset built by joining on left item = right item and left price > right price, the left-sided rows for which there is no greater right-sided price are precisely the per-item rows with the smallest prices. The query runs more than an order of magnitude faster with an index on (item, supplier).

2. Intermediate table solution: Another solution is to derive an intermediate table of aggregated minimum prices, then query that table. Before MySQL 4.1, the intermediate table has to be a temporary table:

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp ( 
  item INT, 
  minprice DECIMAL DEFAULT 0.0 
); 
LOCK TABLES products READ; 
INSERT INTO tmp  
  SELECT item, MIN(price)  
  FROM products  
  GROUP BY item; 

to which you then join the products table to find the matching suppliers:

SELECT products.item, supplier, products.price  
FROM products  
JOIN tmp ON products.item = tmp.item 
WHERE products.price=tmp.minprice; 
UNLOCK TABLES; 
DROP TABLE tmp; 

3. Correlated subquery solution: From MySQL 4.1 on, the temporary table can be a correlated subquery. This is the most intuitively obvious syntax for the problem. It's also the slowest—up to a hundred times slower than the exclusion join, whether the queries are compared with or without indexes:

SELECT item, supplier, price 
FROM products AS p1 
WHERE price = ( 
  SELECT MIN(p2.price) 
  FROM products AS p2 
  WHERE p1.item = p2.item 
); 

4. FROM clause subquery solution: If we move the aggregating subquery from the WHERE clause to the FROM clause, the query improves from a hundred times slower than the self-exclusion join to twenty times faster:

SELECT p.item, p.supplier, p.price 
FROM products AS p 
JOIN ( 
  SELECT item, MIN(price) AS minprice 
  FROM products 
  GROUP BY item 
) AS pm ON p.item = pm.item AND p.price = pm.minprice; 

Some users have trouble mapping elements of this model to their instance of the problem. The model has five elements (or sets of them): 

(i) a table, which might be a view, a single physical table, or a table derived from joins
(ii) one or more grouping columns,
(iii) one or more columns to aggregate,
(iv) one or more columns not mentioned in the GROUP BY clause,
(v) an aggregating job to do, typically MIN() or MAX().

In the product/minimum price solution above: 

(i) table tbl = product 
(ii) grouping column grouping_col = item
(iii) column to aggregate = col_to_aggregate = price
(iv) non-aggregated columns other_detail, ...etc... = supplier
(v) aggregating function = MIN(). 

Here's an interesting variation on the problem. A simple table tracks company branches and the kinds of stock they carry:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS branch_stock; 
CREATE TABLE branch_stock(  
  stock_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT KEY, 
  branch_id INT NOT NULL, 
  stock_item VARCHAR(12) NOT NULL 
); 
INSERT INTO branch_stock (branch_id,stock_item)  
VALUES (1,'trainers'),(1,'trainers'),(1,'jumper'),(2,'tie'),(2,'shoes'); 

How do we find the most frequent product for each branch, including ties? Join the intermediate table of grouped counts to itself on matching branches, non-matching stock and not-greater counts in one than in the other:

SELECT DISTINCT a.*  
FROM (  
  SELECT branch_id, stock_item, COUNT(*) qty 
  FROM branch_stock  
  GROUP BY branch_id, stock_item 
) a  
JOIN (  
  SELECT branch_id, stock_item, COUNT(*) qty 
  FROM branch_stock 
  GROUP BY branch_id, stock_item 
) b ON b.branch_id=a.branch_id AND b.stock_item<>a.stock_item AND b.qty<=a.qty; 
+-----------+------------+-----+ 
| branch_id | stock_item | qty | 
+-----------+------------+-----+ 
|         1 | trainers   |   2 | 
|         2 | shoes      |   1 | 
|         2 | tie        |   1 | 
+-----------+------------+-----+ 

5. Ordered subquery solution: A "trick" solution, made possible by MySQL's non-standard tolerance of GROUP BY when there is no aggregating SELECT expression, uses ORDER BY in a subquery to find the lowest prices, and GROUP BY in the outer query to pick them off:

SELECT * 
FROM ( 
  SELECT * 
  FROM products 
  ORDER BY price ASC 
) AS s 
GROUP BY item; 

It's succinct, it's fast if the query engine can find an index to order on, and it retrieves the prices and associated values in one step, but this query is seldom much faster than the FROM clause subquery described above. 

The self-exclusion join and WHERE clause subquery methods scale badly because they're O(N2). If ordering and grouping columns are indexed, they become O(N * log N), but are still substantially slower than the FROM clause subquery method.

6. Min-Concat-trick solution: Finally, here is a radically different model of the problem. It can find both within-group minima and within-group maxima in a single query. The model aggregates the concatenated within-group grouped column value and the within-group grouping column name in a single string, then uses SUBSTR() to break them apart in the result:

SELECT  
  item, 
  SUBSTR( MIN( CONCAT( LPAD(price,6,0),supplier) ), 7)   AS MinSupplier, 
    LEFT( MIN( CONCAT( LPAD(price,6,0),supplier) ), 6)+0 AS MinPrice, 
  SUBSTR( MAX( CONCAT( LPAD(price,6,0),supplier) ), 7)   AS MaxSupplier, 
    LEFT( MAX( CONCAT( LPAD(price,6,0),supplier) ), 6)+0 AS MaxPrice 
FROM  products 
GROUP BY item; 
+------+-------------+----------+-------------+----------+ 
| item | MinSupplier | MinPrice | MaxSupplier | MaxPrice | 
+------+-------------+----------+-------------+----------+ 
|    1 | 1           |       10 | 2           |       15 | 
|    2 | 2           |       18 | 1           |       21 | 
+------+-------------+----------+-------------+----------+ 

Try all solutions to find which is fastest for your version of the problem. 

To find the top or bottom N per group, you might think the LIMIT clause would work, but LIMIT is limited in subqueries. See Within-group quotas.

A table has multiple rows per key value, and you need to retrieve, say, the first or earliest two rows per key. For example:

INSERT INTO test VALUES 
( 1, '2007-5-01' ),( 1, '2007-5-02' ),( 1, '2007-5-03' ),( 1, '2007-5-04' ), 
( 1, '2007-5-05' ),( 1, '2007-5-06' ),( 2, '2007-6-01' ),( 2, '2007-6-02' ),

Correlation

Probably more bunk has been written about correlation than about any other statistic. We'll keep this short and straight. At its simplest, correlation is a statistical measure of non-random, linear association between pairs of values in a dataset. It's denoted by r, and varies from -1 through +1, where -1 indicates perfect inverse correlation (the regression line goes down left to right), 0 indicates no correlation (there is no regression line; it's just a scatterplot), and +1 indicates perfect direct correlation (the regression line goes up left to right).

For an example we'll use a bit of imaginary data:

drop table if exists t; 
create table t (id int, x int, y float); 
insert into t values 
(1 , 68, 4.1),(2 , 71, 4.6),(3 , 62, 3.8),(4 , 75, 4.4),(5 , 58, 3.2), 
(6 , 60, 3.1),(7 , 67, 3.8),(8 , 68, 4.1),(9 , 71, 4.3),(10, 69, 3.7), 
(11, 68, 3.5),(12, 67, 3.2),(13, 63, 3.7),(14, 62, 3.3),(15, 60, 3.4), 
(16, 63, 4.0),(17, 65, 4.1),(18, 67, 3.8),(19, 63, 3.4),(20, 61, 3.6);

Median

Statistically, the median is the middle value--the value that is smaller than that found in half of all remaining rows, and larger than that found in the other half:

SELECT a.hours As Median 
FROM BulbLife As a, bulbLife AS b 
GROUP BY a.Hours 
Having Sum( Sign( 1-Sign(b.Hours-a.Hours ))) = Floor(( Count(*)+1)/2)  ; 

This formula works, but it doesn't scale—it's O(n*n)—and it's awkward to use. 

So we posted a MySQL implementation of Torben Mogenson's algorithm for calculating the median (http://ndevilla.free.fr/median/median/node20.html). It's said to be amongst the fastest, but it proved too slow. Then Joe Wynne offered an algorithm which looks correct and does scale. Here it is as a MySQL stored procedure:

Pivot table basics: rows to columns

From table tbl( class, member ), you want to cross-tabulate all classes with their members. In SQL terms, you aggregate members over classes. In MySQL:

SELECT class,GROUP_CONCAT(member)

With that simple query, you're halfway toward cross-tabulation, halfway to implementing a simple CUBE, and halfway to basic entity-attribute-value (EAV) logic. This is easier to see if we have two columns, rather than just one, to tabulate against the grouping column:

Backslashes in data

Backslashes multiply weirdly: 

SELECT 'a\b' RLIKE 'a\b';  

returns 1, as does...

SELECT 'a\\b' RLIKE 'a\\\\b';  

because in a pair of backslashes, the second is not escaped by the first, so to compare two literals you double each backslash in the RLIKE argument. But if you are querying a table for such a string from the MySQL client, this doubling happens twice--once in the client, and once in the database--so to find a column value matching 'a\\b', you need to write...

SELECT desc FROM xxx WHERE desc RLIKE 'aa\\\\\\\\bb'; 

That's eight backslashes to match two!

Since version 5, the MySQL implementation of information_schema (I_S) helps meet Codd's requirement. I_S supplies metadata in tables, so it's the first place to look for how to compare the structures of two databases. 

Elsewhere on this page there is a simple query template for comparing data in two structurally similar tables:

SELECT MIN(TableName) as TableName, id, col1, col2, col3, ... 
FROM ( 
  SELECT 'Table a' as TableName, a.id, a.col1, a.col2, a.col3, ... 
  FROM a 
  UNION ALL 
  SELECT 'Table b' as TableName, b.id, b.col1, b.col2, b.col3, ... 
  FROM b 
) AS tmp

Rename Database

Sometimes it's necessary to rename a database. There are two crucial reasons there's no such command in MySQL: there's no way to lock a whole database, and information_schema isn't transactional. 

MySQL 5.1.7 introduced a RENAME DATABASE command, but the command left several unchanged database objects behind, and was found to lose data, so it was dropped in 5.1.23.

The operating system's view of a database is that it's just another folder on the disk. That may tempt you to think you could just rename it. Don't. 

Renaming a database is perfectly safe if and only if:
it has no tables with foreign keys that reference, or are referenced by, a table in another database;
it has no procedures, functions or triggers that reference objects in another database;
no other database has tables, functions, procedures or triggers that reference this database.
So there is one safe way to rename a database: dump it completely ...

Foreign key basics

Referential integrity (RI) is data consistency between related tables. ACID-compliant database engines like InnoDB provide foreign keys to automate RI maintenance. Simple example: customers have orders, which have items; by defining a customers foreign key in the orders table and an orders foreign key in the items table, you ensure that no orders or items row gets orphaned.

SQL implements FKs as key objects defined by CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE. MySQL syntax is:

[CONSTRAINT symbol] FOREIGN KEY [constraintID] (keycolumnname, ...) 
REFERENCES tbl_name (keycolumnname, ...) 
[ ON DELETE { RESTRICT | CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION } ] 
[ ON UPDATE { RESTRICT | CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION } ] 

To drop a FK in MySQL you need to know the CONSTRAINT symbol, so it's good practice to adopt a standard naming convention and use it here.

Change or drop a foreign key

To change a foreign key, first drop it, then declare the new, revised foreign key. The syntax for declaring a foreign key is ...

[CONSTRAINT [constraint_name]]  
FOREIGN KEY [key_name] (keycol_name,...) reference_definition 

and the syntax for dropping one is ...

DROP FOREIGN KEY constraint_name 

Notice that you can omit the CONSTRAINT when you declare a foreign key, but the only way to DROP a foreign key is to reference it by the constraint_name which you probably never specified! 

There should be a circle of hell reserved for designers who build inconsistencies like this into their tools. The only way round this one is to run SHOW CREATE TABLE to find out what the foreign key's constraint_name is, so you can write the DROP statement. Here is a wee test case:
drop table if exists a,b;
create table a(i int primary key)engine=innodb;
create table b(i int,foreign key(i) references a(i)) engine=innodb;
show create table\G

CREATE TABLE `b` (
  `i` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  KEY `i` (`i`),
  CONSTRAINT `b_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`i`) REFERENCES `a` (`i`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1

-- drop and recreate the FK:
alter table b drop foreign key b_ibfk_1;
alter table b add foreign key(i) references a(i) on update cascade;
show create table b\G

Create Table: CREATE TABLE `b` (
  `i` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  KEY `i` (`i`),
  CONSTRAINT `b_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`i`) REFERENCES `a` (`i`) ON UPDATE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1

drop table a,b;

Find child tables

Starting with MySQL 5, you can find all tables which have foreign key references to a given table with an information_schema query, here encapsulated in a stored procedure which takes two arguments, a database name and a table name. When the table argument is blank or NULL, the procedure returns all parent-child links where the parent table is in the specified database; otherwise it returns parent-child links for the specified parent table:

Find sequenced duplicates

A table that tracks time periods may require period uniqueness. That means it has no sequenced duplicates.

If a table has columns processID, start_date and end_date, those three columns are period unique if there exists no pair of rows with the same processID and overlapping start_date and end_date values. If there is such a pair of rows, the table exhibits sequenced duplication. 

Another way of saying it: if an instant is the smallest datetime unit of start_date and end_date columns, then if there are no sequenced duplicates, there is exactly one processID value at any instant.

Here is a query to find sequenced duplicates for those columns:

SELECT t.processid  
FROM tbl t  
WHERE EXISTS (  
  SELECT * FROM tbl AS t3  
  WHERE t3.processid IS NULL  
)  
OR EXISTS (  
  SELECT * FROM tbl AS t1  
  WHERE 1 < (  
    SELECT COUNT(processid)  
    FROM tbl AS t2  
    WHERE t1.processid = t2.processid  
      AND t1.start_date < t2.end_date  
      AND t2.start_date < t1.end_date  
  )  
);

Peak visit counts by datetime period

You have a visits table (id int, start datetime, end datetime), and you wish to track peak visit counts. A simple solution is to self-join on non-matching IDs and overlapping visit times, group by ID, then order by the resulting counts:

SELECT a.id,group_concat(b.id) as Overlaps, count(b.id)+1 as OverlapCount 
FROM visits a 
JOIN visits b on a.id < b.id and a.start < b.end and b.start < a.end 
GROUP BY a.id 
ORDER BY OverlapCount DESC;

Appointments available

Given a clinic of physicians, patients and appointments, how to find an available appointment time for a given physician?

This is a variant of the [Not] Exists query pattern. Though we can write it with subqueries, performance will be crisper with a join. But finding data that is not there requires a join to data which is there. So in addition to tables for appointments, doctors and patients, we need a table of all possible appointment datetimes. Here's a schema illustrating the idea ...

CREATE TABLE a_dt (         -- POSSIBLE APPOINTMENT DATES AND TIMES 
  d DATE, 
  t TIME 
); 
CREATE TABLE a_drs (        -- DOCTORS 
  did INT                   -- doctor id 
);

Trees of known depth

A tree is a hierarchy where each node except the root has one parent. A parent-child link is an edge. Edges in a tree of known depth can be queried with n-1 self-joins where n is the number of edges from top to bottom. Here is a simple example of depth 2:

Approximate joins

There are two main ways to reconcile payments against charges:
Open Item: match payments against individual charges, typically by carrying the charge number in the payments table
Statement: list and sum all charges and all payments, and show the difference as the outstanding balance.
The Open Item method needs a foolproof way to match payments to charges, but what if the customer neglected to return a copy of the invoice, or to write the invoice number on the cheque? Reconciliation staff spend much of their time resolving such problems.

Can we help? Yes! It won't be entirely foolproof, but it will drastically cut down the onerous work of reconciliation.

Classroom scheduling

You have n student classes of known size, and m classrooms of known size, where m>=n. What's the best algorithm for assigning as many classes as possible to rooms of adequate size?

It's a version of the combinatorial knapsack problem. It's known to be NP-complete, which means it's possible to verify any correct solution but there is no known algorithm for quickly finding a correct solution. How then to proceed?

Early in 2010 Joe Celko resurrected the problem in a Simple Talk column, and challenged readers to improve on SQL Server solutions he'd published in the third edition of his "SQL for Smarties". Here's his small version of the problem modified for MySQL:

Data-driven joins

Data-driven table relationships are hard to maintain, but sometimes they cannot be avoided. How do we build joins for them? One way is to use a CASE statement in the SELECT list to handle the joining possibilities. In this example, the parent.linktable column determines the name of the table where a particular parent row's data is. The method is fine when the number of child tables is small:

USE test; 
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS parent, child1, child2; 

CREATE TABLE parent ( 
  id INT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY,

Start with buyers of x. The table that summarises this information might be a View that encapsulates joins from customers to orders to orderitems to products, perhaps scoped on a recent date range. Here we ignore all such detail. We focus only on the SQL patterns that solve this kind of problem:

Join or subquery?

Usually, a JOIN is faster than an uncorrelated subquery. For example in the sakila test database, customer is a parent of rental (via customer_id) which in turn is a parent of payment (via rental_id). The subquery version of a query for whether a customer has made payments and rentals... 

SELECT DISTINCT c.customer_id 
FROM customer c 
WHERE c.customer_id IN ( 
   SELECT r.customer_id  
   FROM rental r 
   JOIN payment p USING (rental_id)  
   WHERE c.customer_id = 599; 
); 

is eight times slower than the join version...
  
SELECT DISTINCT c.customer_id 
FROM customer c 
JOIN rental r USING (customer_id) 
JOIN payment p USING (rental_id)  
WHERE c.customer_id = 599; 

Running EXPLAIN on the two queries reveals why: the subquery version has to read most customer rows, while the join version proceeds inside out and discovers it needs to read just one customer row.

SELECT parent.id 
FROM parent  
LEFT JOIN child ON parent.id = child.parent_id  
WHERE child.parent_id IS NULL; 

or with a NOT EXISTS subquery, which is logically equivalent to the exclusion join, but usually performs much slower:

SELECT parent.id AS ParentID 
FROM parent 
WHERE NOT EXISTS ( 
  SELECT parent.id 
  FROM parent  
  JOIN child ON parent.ID = child.parent_id

Suppose you have a phone book of names, addresses, etc. You are displaying 20 rows per page, you're on page 100, and you want to display page 99. How do you do this knowing only what page you are on?

Assuming...
1-based page numbers
you are on page P
each page shows N rows
then the general formula for translating a 1-based page number into a first LIMIT argument is ...

 MAX(0,P-1) * N 

which for the 99th 20-row page evaluates to 1960, and the second argument to LIMIT is just N, so to see page 99, write...
  
 SELECT ... LIMIT (1960, N); 

The trouble with this is scaling. MySQL doesn't optimise LIMIT at all well. SELECT ... LIMIT 1000000,20 will unfortunately retrieve not just the twenty rows starting at the millionth row; it will retrieve a million and twenty rows before it shows you the 20 you asked for! The bigger the result, the longer LIMIT takes. 

What's the alternative? Build pagination logic into the WHERE clause, and ensure that there is a covering index for the paginating column. On a table of 100,000 indexed random integers, SELECT ... WHERE ... for the last 20 integers in the table is twice as fast as the comparable LIMIT query. With a million integers, it's more than 500 times faster!

If your interface calls for showing only 20 rows per page on a given order, retrieve the twenty rows, plus the row just before the set if it exists, plus the next row after those twenty if it exists. When the user clicks the Previous Page button, adjust the WHERE clause to specify rows where the key value is <= the row just before the current set and ORDER BY the current index DESC LIMIT 20; likewise when the user clicks the Next Page button, have the WHERE clause specify key values >= that of the row just after the set, and ORDER BY the current index ASC LIMIT 20.

All X for which all Y are Z (relational division)

You have an election database with tables listing political parties, election districts, and candidates running for parties in those districts. You want to know which parties have candidates running in all districts. Under Aggregates we show a GROUP BY solution (here). 

If there are reasons not to aggregate, relational division can solve the problem. The basic idea in relational division is that, aside from aggregation, SQL has no direct way to express "all Xs for which all Y are Z", but does have a NOT EXISTS operator, so we can express "all Xs for which all Y are Z" in SQL as a double negative: "all Xs for which no Y is not Z". Once you think of formulating the question this way, the query almost writes itself:

SELECT DISTINCT party FROM parties 
WHERE NOT EXISTS ( 
  SELECT * FROM districts  
  WHERE NOT EXISTS ( 
    SELECT * FROM candidates 
    WHERE candidates.party=parties.party AND candidates.district=districts.district 
  ) 
);

Who makes all the parts for a given assembly?

One way to arrive at the answer is by asking: What are the assembly-supplier pairs such that no part of the assembly is not made by the supplier? That's relational division again, formulated for two tables by Stephen Todd. Given assemblyparts(assembly,part) and partsuppliers(part,supplier) tables, here is a query that Joe Celko credits to Pierre Mullin.

SELECT DISTINCT  
  AP1.assembly,  
  SP1.supplier 
FROM AssemblyParts AS AP1, PartSuppliers AS SP1 
WHERE NOT EXISTS ( 
  SELECT * 
  FROM AssemblyParts AS AP2 
  WHERE AP2.assembly = AP1.assembly 
  AND NOT EXISTS ( 
    SELECT SP2.part 
    FROM PartSuppliers AS SP2 
    WHERE SP2.part = AP2.part AND SP2.supplier = SP1.supplier 
  ) 
);

Find average row-to-row time interval

You have a table of sequential times, and you're asked to report the average time interval between them in seconds. 

Assuming table t with timestamp column ts and no ts duplicate values, the mean time difference between consecutive rows is the difference between the smallest (earliest) and largest (latest) timestamp divided by the rowcount - 1:

Select TimeStampDiff(SECOND, Min(ts), Max(ts) ) / ( Count(DISTINCT(ts)) -1 )  
FROM t 

Not sure of the formula? 

1. The mean distance between consecutive rows is the sum of distances between consecutive rows, divided by the number of consecutive rows.

2. The sum of differences between consecutive rows is just the distance between the first row and last sorted row (assuming they are sorted by timestamp).

3. The number of consecutive rows is the total number of rows - 1.

Find missing values in a range

You have a table named tbl with an integer primary key named id, and you need to know what key values between 0 and 999999 are missing in the table.

The simplest solution is an exclusion join from a virtual table of sequential numbers to the target table:

create or replace view v as  
  select 0 i union select 1 union select 2 union select 3 union select 4  
  union select 5 union select 6 union select 7 union select 8 union select 9;  

select x.i 
from ( 
  select a.i*100000 + b.i*10000 + c.i*1000 + d.i*100 + e.i*10 + f.i as i  
  from v a  
  join v b  
  join v c  
  join v d  
  join v e  
  join v f 
) x 
left join tbl on x.i=tbl.id 
where tbl.id is null

Make values of a column sequential

You have a table tbl with a column whose values can be freely overwritten and which needs to be filled with perfectly sequential values starting with 1:

SET @i=0; 
UPDATE tbl SET keycol=(@i:=@i+1);  

But more often, what you need is a mechanism for guaranteeing an unbroken sequence of integer key values whenever a row is inserted. 

Here is the bad news: auto_increment does not provide this logic, for example it does not prevent inserton failures, editing of the column, or subsequent deletion.

The good news is that the logic for guaranteeing an unbroken sequence is straightforward:

(i) use InnoDB 

(ii) create a table with the desired sequence in one column and further column(s) to track use (to use such a table for sequential columns in multiple other tables, provide a tracking column for each such table)

(iii) write Triggers to fetch the next available sequential key from that table, mark it used, and assign it on Insert

(iv) put all such logic inside transaction blocks

(v) prohibit deletion in the table.

Variable-length argument for query IN() clause

To have an sproc accept a variable-length parameter list for an IN(...) clause in a query, code the sproc to PREPARE the query statement:

DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS passInParam;

CREATE PROCEDURE passInParam( IN qry VARCHAR(100), IN param VARCHAR(1000) ) 
BEGIN 
  SET @qry = CONCAT( qry, param, ')' ); 
  PREPARE stmt FROM @qry; 
  EXECUTE stmt; 
  DROP PREPARE stmt; 
END; 
| 
DELIMITER ; 

For this example, the query string should be of the form:

SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... IN (  

but so long as it has those elements, it can be as complex as you like. When you call the sproc:
1. Quote each argument with a pair of single quotes, 
2. Separate these quoted arguments with commas, 
3. Surround the whole param string with another set of single quotes: 

CALL passInParam( 'SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE colval IN (', ('''abc'',''def'',''ghi''' ));

Count substrings

To count instances of a search string in a target string ...
in the target string, replace the search string with a single character,
subtract the length of the modified target string from the length of the original target string,
divide that by the length of the search string:

SET @str  = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";  
SET @find = "the"; 
SELECT ROUND(((LENGTH(@str) - LENGTH(REPLACE(LCASE(@str), @find, '')))/LENGTH(@find)),0)  
AS COUNT;  
+-------+ 
| COUNT | 
+-------+ 
|     2 | 
+-------+ 

Note that REPLACE() does a case-sensitive search; to get a case-insensitive result you must coerce target and search strings to one case.

To remove decimals from the result:

SELECT CAST((LENGTH(@str) - LENGTH(REPLACE(LCASE(@str)), @find, '')))/LENGTH(@find) AS SIGNED) AS COUNT;

Levenshtein distance

The Levenshtein distance between two strings is the minimum number of operations needed to transform one string into the other, where an operation may be insertion, deletion or substitution of one character. Jason Rust published this MySQL algorithm for it at http://www.codejanitor.com/wp/.

CREATE FUNCTION levenshtein( s1 VARCHAR(255), s2 VARCHAR(255) ) 
  RETURNS INT 
  DETERMINISTIC 
  BEGIN 
    DECLARE s1_len, s2_len, i, j, c, c_temp, cost INT; 
    DECLARE s1_char CHAR; 
    -- max strlen=255 
    DECLARE cv0, cv1 VARBINARY(256); 
    SET s1_len = CHAR_LENGTH(s1), s2_len = CHAR_LENGTH(s2), cv1 = 0x00, j = 1, i = 1, c = 0; 
    IF s1 = s2 THEN 
      RETURN 0;

Proper case

The basic idea is...
lower-case the string
upper-case the first character if it is a-z, and any other a-z character that follows a punctuation character
Here is the function. To make it work with strings long than 128 characters, change its input and return declarations accordingly:

DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS proper; 
SET GLOBAL  log_bin_trust_function_creators=TRUE; 
DELIMITER | 
CREATE FUNCTION proper( str VARCHAR(128) ) 
RETURNS VARCHAR(128) 
BEGIN 
  DECLARE c CHAR(1);

Retrieve octets from IP addresses

If ip is for the form N.N.N.N where N may be 1, 2 or 3 digits, how to group and count by just the first three octets, ie the ip class?

SELECT  
  LEFT(ip, CHAR_LENGTH(ip) - LOCATE('.', REVERSE(ip))) as ipclass, 
  COUNT(*) 
FROM tbl 
GROUP BY ipclass;  

Hamilton Turner notes we can find the first octet with LEFT(ip,LOCATE('.',ip)-1).

Split a string


CREATE FUNCTION SPLIT_STR( s VARCHAR(255), delim VARCHAR(16),  pos INT ) 
RETURNS VARCHAR(255) 
RETURN REPLACE( SUBSTRING( SUBSTRING_INDEX(s, delim, pos), 
                           LENGTH(SUBSTRING_INDEX(s, delim, pos -1)) + 1), 
                delim,  
                '' 
              ); 

For longer strings, change the datatype.
